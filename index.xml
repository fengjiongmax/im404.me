      <description>This is part 5 of the 2d/3d(game/engine) conversion used in my puzzle game: Ladder Box, which is available on Steam:
  
You can find all the textures, scripts in this GitHub repo: https://github.com/fengjiongmax/3D_iso_in_2D
Godot 3.2.x is used in this project, you can check the commits for what&amp;rsquo;s new in each part of this series.
Limit user input In the last 5 part of this series, we&amp;rsquo;ve made all the states working, but we did not limit user input when the movable are moving, so this could happen:</description>

The problem If you set the board like this:
new_movable(0,1,0) new_movable(0,0,0) new_movable(0,0,1) new_movable(1,0,0) run the game and hit ‘Z’, you’ll see: the one V3(0,0,0) will stay still, but this is not what we want, so let’s figure out how this happened and how to solve this.</description>

Jump state When a movable has a block at its same height in its moving direction, that movable will switch to the jump state.</description>

Folks on Reddit curious how I make this, I tried to briefly describe the overall idea of how to make this happen but did not dive deep, and now I&amp;rsquo;m gonna tell you guys how I make this work.
I&amp;rsquo;m using Godot Engine in this series, but you can skip the engine-specific part (scripting, scene building) and do it in other engines/frameworks, and I highly encourage you to do so.</description>
